The things Ihave did For Raw-Data > 
                      1) Dropping null values and NaN things.

                      2) Did Exploratory Analysis using Matplotlib, seaborn and figure out the requirements .
                      
                      3) Converted the Skills Column from Categorical Column to Numeric Column i.e. OneHot Encoding. for Raw Data
